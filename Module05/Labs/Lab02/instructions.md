1. Fill out the class in the file `Employee.java`  
1. class `Employee` INHERITS from class `Person` and has four data members:
    - `name`, `age`, `designation` and `salary`. Don't forget that `name` and `age` will be inherited from `Person`.  `Designation` is a kind of job title 
1. Still in the file `Employee.java`
    - Write a constructor for class `Employee` to initialise the member fields whenever an object of class `Employee` is created.  It will require four parameters

    - Write a member function (`display`) that displays ALL details for an `Employee` object

 Person class has been provided for you in this lab, to use unchanged

4. Now in `OOProgramming.java`, create 4 `Employee` objects (each with their own details, just make up some data) and display them on the screen
