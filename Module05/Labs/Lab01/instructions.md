1. Fill out the class in the file `Person.java`  
1. Give it two member fields (data members) : `String name` and `int age`
1.  In the same file; write a constructor to initialise the member fields, when an object of class `Person` is created
1. Write a member function that displays `name` and `age` for a `Person` object

Now back in the `OOProgramming.java` file

1. Create 3 `Person` objects (each with their own name and age) and display them on the screen
    - Have a Think :  where will you write code to create an object of the `class Person`, and call the display function?
1. When your code is ready you will need to compile (`javac`) BOTH files
1. Run just the class containing the main function (`java OOProgramming`)
