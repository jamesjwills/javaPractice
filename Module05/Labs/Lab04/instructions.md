This program will count the number of instances created
1. In the class `Item`, add a `public static int` variable named `instanceCount`. By being static it is shared by all instances of `Item`
1. In main, print the `instanceCount` variable before and after creating an `Item`.  (You will find that `instanceCount` must be public.) It should show zero items before creation and one after
1. Once you have that working...
1. Add a `static` method to print a message of the form "There are 2 instances"
1. Call that function before and after creating the `Item` again.  It should show zero items before creation and one afterwards.
