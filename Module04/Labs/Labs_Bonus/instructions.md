### Menu Driven Program

Write a menu driven program which accepts an integer number, and offers the following options:
1. Calculate Factorial of a number
2. Check if number is Prime or not
3. Check if number is Odd or Even
4. Exit

Print your menu options at the console and prompt the user for an input.

You may want to consider using a switch statement to drive your menu choices.

You may also want to think about using separate functions for each menu option.

You can write your program without one or both of these suggestions, if you wish.

Finally, what do you need for your menu to run repeatedly until you choose to exit?

### Roman Numerals

This is an Advanced Bonus Lab ... if you feel like really challenging yourself!

Try to solve the other bonus lab(s) in this module before you try this one

Do NOT expect yourself to be able to solve this in one sitting! 

The logic for this is more complex than may appear at first.  It's a really good idea to get a pen and paper and write down step by step, what you may need to do

You may want to consider using some of the things you've learnt so far :
- Arrays
- Loops
- Strings
- Conditional Flow stataments etc.

This is an excellent coding challenge to build up your skills

IF your instructor has the time, she/he MAY even choose to go through the solution with you. That being said, if you have the time and inclination to try it yourself, go for it!  Have fun.
Here's your challenge ...

Write a Program to convert any 4 digit year to its Roman Numeral Equivalent 
Accept the year at the console as an integer 
Use the following table to help you .... 
```
DECIMAL      ROMAN EQUIVALENT
1                i
5                v
10               x
50               l
100              c
500              d
1000             m
```
A few examples :
the Roman equivalent of 1002 is mii  
the Roman equivalent of 1525 is mdxxv
the Roman equivalent of 1988 is mdcccclxxxviii     (We promised you a challenge!)

Good luck! The screen is yours ....
