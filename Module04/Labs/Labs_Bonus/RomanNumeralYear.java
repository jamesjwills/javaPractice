    // Do NOT expect yourself to be able to solve this in one sitting! 
    // The logic for this is more complex than may appear at first ...
    
    // It's a really good idea to get a pen and paper and write down step by step, 
    // what you may need to do

    // You may want to consider using some of the things you've learnt so far :
    // Arrays, Loops, Strings, Conditional Flow stataments etc.

    // This is an excellent coding challenge to build up your skills
    // IF your instructor has the time, she/he MAY even choose to go through the solution with you
    
    // That being said, if you have the time and inclination to try it yourself, go for it! Have fun!
    // Here's your challenge ...

    // ************************************* //

    // Write a Program to convert any 4 digit year to it's Roman Numeral Equivalent 
    // Accept the year at the console as an integer 

    // Use the following table to help you .... 

    // DECIMAL      ROMAN EQUIVALENT
    // 1                i
    // 5                v
    // 10               x
    // 50               l
    // 100              c
    // 500              d
    // 1000             m

    // A few examples :

    // the Roman equivalent of 1002 is mii  
    // the Roman equivalent of 1525 is mdxxv
    // the Roman equivalent of 1988 is mdcccclxxxviii     (We promised you a challenge!)

    // Good luck! The screen is yours .... write some code here ....
