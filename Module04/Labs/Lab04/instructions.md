
## Overloaded Functions

1. Write three separate functions **with the same name**, that add different types of things
In other words, write overloads of the same function, to add :
    - Two `ints`
    - Two `doubles`
    - Two `Strings`

1. Take care that the result of the addition in each function is stored in the correct type of variable. For example, if you add two integers, the sum must be stored in an integer

1. Have a think about : What does it mean to add two strings?
1. Return the result of each of these functions to main() and display it
