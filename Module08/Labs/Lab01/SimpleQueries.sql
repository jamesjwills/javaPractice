-- Install the pubs database
-- Open the file at instpubs.sql
-- Feel free to take a look at it, 
-- it's a mix of DDL (to create tables and other objects - including objects not mentioned in this
-- course) and DML to insert sample data
-- execute the whole file (press F5).  It takes a few seconds to run


-- Now write some queries of your own.  Here are some suggestions.
-- Have a go at the suggestions; when you have done them; experiment!

-- FIRST switch to processing the pubs database - click the dropdown near the top left and choose
-- the pubs database
-- Now click the New Query button
-- You can run your queries by clicking Execute or pressing F5


-- 1) Retrieve every column of every row from the titles table


-- 2) Retrieve just title_id, and title for all books with an advance of 5000


-- 3) Retrieve all books with the type psychology


-- 4) Retrieve all books with the type psychology and an advance greater than 5000



-- 5) Retrieve all books with an advance greater than 5000...
--    In a separate sql query retrieve all those with an advance <= 5000
--    These two should return 16 rows between them, yet there are 18 in the table
--    Why are two missing?


-- 6) Calculate the year to date royalties on each book.  The royalty column in the table
--    is the percentage paid to the author
--    display the title_id, the title and the estimate
