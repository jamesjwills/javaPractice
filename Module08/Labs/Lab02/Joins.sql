-- Suggestions for join queries
--

-- 1) For each title look up the name of the publisher from the publishers table.
--    Display the title_id, title and the publisher name



-- 2) Add the publisher's id number.



-- 3) select from the sales table, show the ordernumber and the quantity.
--    Also show the name of each title, the publisher for the title
--    and the name of the store.  To do this you will need several joins.
--    Build the query in stages.  Start with sales joined to stores, to 
--    get the store name.
--    Add in titles to get the title
--    Then add in publishers to get the publisher name
--    You can use Management Studio's tree view (the left hand window)
--    to drill down into a table and determine the columns



-- 4) select from the sales table, showing the total sales for each title



-- 5) select from the sales table, showing the total sales for each title per store




-- 6) Use a join to include the title from the titles table into #5




-- 7) And another join to include the publisher name from the publisher table
