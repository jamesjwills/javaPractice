
## Solicit forename and surname from keyboard and display on screen

1. Write some code to enter your first name and last name separately at the console
1. Store both into two separate String objects,
1. Concatenate them into your full name (assuming First and Last name together form a full name)
1. Display your full name on the screen
    - For example, the output on your screen can look like this
    - My name is : Mary Jones

1. BONUS CHALLENGE : As an added challenge, if you have a middle name too, then accept your first, middle and last names into three String variables and print out your entire full name
    - But make sure it works with your first and last names, first!!
    - If you don't have a middle name why not invent one?
