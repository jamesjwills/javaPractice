1. Remember when you wrote the seven times multiplication table for mutipliers 1 to 10?
    - It's time to try your hand at it again. This time, write your code using loops

    - Expected results 7, 14, 21, 28...
1. First, try and do it using a while loop.
    - Write and test that now


1. Now try using even fewerlines of code, by using a for loop
