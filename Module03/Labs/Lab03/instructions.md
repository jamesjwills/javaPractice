
## Using the `Scanner` class to input a `String`


1. Write some code to enter your first name at the console (once the program is running), 
1. Use the `java.util.Scanner` class to read an entire line from the standard input stream.  Store it into a `String` object 
1. Display it on the screen once you have finished entering it

For example, the output on your screen might look like this 
> Please enter your first name      **<-- already done for you**
> Janet         **<-- the line you enter**
> My name is : Janet **<- your program output**
 
Of course, feel free to substitute your own name here! Unless you really are called Janet
