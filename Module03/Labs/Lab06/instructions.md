1. Write a program to create and populate a 2 x 3 Matrix of Integers, and populate it (enter elements into it)

    - Enter the elements from the console when the program is running
    - Use appropriate print statements to prompt the user
    - For Example - Enter Element (1,2) : ...
1. Once you have filled up the array with elements, execute each of the following in order

    - Print out the elements of the matrix in order, so it looks like a matrix
    - The first element of the Matrix ( HINT : It's always the one at position (0 , 0) )
    - All the elements of the Second Row
    - All the elements of the Third Column
    - The Sum of the Elements in EACH Row (In a 2 x 3 Matrix, there are 2 Rows)
    - The Sum of the Elements in EACH Column (In a 2 x 3 Matrix, there are 3 Columns)

1. Complete each listed item and make sure your program is running correctly everytime, BEFORE you move onto the next item; this way you build your program incrementally)
    - For example, if you have a 2 x 3 Matrix with the values
        > 1 2 3
        4 5 6

    - Then , your output on the screen should be
        >1 2 3
        >4 5 6
        >First Element of Matrix : 1
        >
        >Elements of the Second Row : 4 5 6
        >Elements of the Third Column : 3 6
        >
        > Sum of the Elements in Row 1 = 6 , Row 2 = 15
        >
        > The Sum of the Elements in Column 1 = 5, Column 2 = 7, Column 3 = 9
