### ArmstrongNumbers


Write some code to print all Armstrong Numbers between 1 and 500

If sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number.  

For example, 153 = ( 1 * 1 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 5 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 3 * 3 )

That is, each of the digits of 153, when cubed , add up to 153 itself.  Pretty cool!

You need to think about how you can capture each digit of a number to start
with

Since the program will print out all Armstrong Numbers between 1 and 500,
you can safely assume that the *maximum* number of digits of any arnstrong
number will be three (3); the minimum number of digits is of course just one
(1)

HINT : You may want to use loops, conditional checks and functions in your
code

### Range

Write a Program to calculate the Range of a set of five numbers. The Range of any set is defined as the difference between the smallest and the largest number in that set.

For example : Consider the set of numbers 15, 23, 4, 65, 10

The Range of this set would be : Largest (65) - Smallest (4) = 61

Have the user enter 5 numbers at the console, and then calulate the Range (If you would like an extra challenge, ONCE you have acheived a working program, you can later tweak your code to accept *any* number of inputs from the console)

For this lab, you may assume that your code works for any set of positive numbers (exclude zero from numbers that can be entered)

HAVE A THINK : What should your code do if a user enters a negative number? Or Zero?

HINT : Would some sort of error message help? What else might your code need?
