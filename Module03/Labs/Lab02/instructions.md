1. Store the daily temperatures in your city for five days and print them
    - Do this by creating an array of double
        - Hint : use loops to print the array out try at least the counted loop and the range for (aka for each) loop

        - Ie expected results 35.5, 28.6, 25.3 (make up any temperatures you like)
