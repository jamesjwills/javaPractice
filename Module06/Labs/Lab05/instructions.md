
## Debugging Part 4

This program prints out the number of days in any given month

It takes in a String object that holds the name of a month from the console to do this. For example, if the month entered is March, when the program runs, we should see the number of days in the month of March is 31

For this lab, do not worry about leap years ... assume February has 28 days.

However, this program sometimes gives us the correct output, and at other times the output is wrong. Run this program for the months of January, February, April and September

What do you notice each time? Which months seem to have the program running corectly and which don't?

Here's a handy reminder in the form of a (kind of!) poem to help you with which months have how many days

30 Days in September,
April, June and November
All the rest have 31
Except February alone
which has 28 days each year

Your task is to debug the program and have it run correctly for all months

Good luck!
