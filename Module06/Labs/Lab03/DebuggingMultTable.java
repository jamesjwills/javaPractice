    // prompt
    // Press Ctrl key and C together at the same time. You might need to do this!

    // First, Run this program at the command prompt to discover what the unexpected
    // output or "bug" might be. It's possible you may see no output at all ... that
    // is a valid bug too. Or, you may see the compiler give you an error message.
    // (You might want to remember how to use Ctrl + C keys when you do this! )

    // Next, go through the code LINE BY LINE, and try to figure out what may be
    // causing the program to behave unexpectedly

    // Once you have identified the bug or bugs, edit the code / add new code to
    // get the program working properly.

    // Good luck!

    // HINT : It can be helpful to write down the result of every line of code on
    // a piece of rough paper ... just to help you with your debugging process
    // Some of the most experienced programmers in the world still do this to help
    // them debug a program!

    // When you have it (apparently!) working.... Are you SURE there are no more
    // bugs???
