
## Debugging Part 2

The code in this file should print the multiplication table of a number
entered at the console, from 1 to 10 ....

For example, if the number entered is 3, when the program runs, we should see
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
....
( and so on until )
3 * 10 = 30

However, there is a bug lurking in this code, and it doesn't work as expected
when run ...

Your task is to Debug this program!

*** IMPORTANT  **** : If for any reason, you need to get back to the command prompt press Ctrl key and C together at the same time. You might need to do this!

First, Run this program at the command prompt to discover what the unexpected output or "bug" might be. It's possible you may see no output at all ... that is a valid bug too. Or, you may see the compiler give you an error message.

(You might want to remember how to use Ctrl + C keys when you do this! )

Next, go through the code LINE BY LINE, and try to figure out what may be causing the program to behave unexpectedly. Once you have identified the bug or bugs, edit the code/add new code to get the program working properly.

Good luck!

HINT : It can be helpful to write down the result of every line of code on a piece of rough paper ... just to help you with your debugging process. Some of the most experienced programmers in the world still do this to help them debug a program!

When you have it (apparently!) working.... Are you SURE there are no more bugs???
