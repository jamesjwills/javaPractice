The code in this file should run and print all the squares between 1 and 100

There is no input required at the terminal / console. For example, The output should be ....

The list of squares between the numbers 1 to 100 is :
1
4
9
16
25
.....
( and so on until )
81
100
However, there is an error somewhere in this code, and it doesn't work as expected when run ...

Your task is to discover the error in this program!

*** IMPORTANT **** : If for any reason, you need to get back to the command prompt. Press Ctrl key and C together at the same time. You might need to do this!

First, Run this program at the command prompt to discover what the unexpected output or "bug" might be. It's possible you may see no output at all ... that is a valid bug too. Or, you may see the compiler give you an error message.

(You might want to remember how to use Ctrl + C keys when you do this! )

Next, go through the code LINE BY LINE, and try to figure out what may be causing the program to behave unexpectedly.  Once you have identified the bug or bugs, edit the code / add new code to get the program working properly.

Good luck!

HINT : It can be helpful to write down the result of every line of code on a piece of rough paper ... just to help you with your debugging process Some of the most experienced programmers in the world still do this to help them debug a program.

Also, if you are debugging a program that contains function calls, it is helpful
to go through the program line by line, IN THE ORDER OF FLOW OF CONTROL. Feel free to add `print` statements at various points in the code to help you figure out what may be going on
