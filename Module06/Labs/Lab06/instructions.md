
## JavaDocs

Add javadoc comments to the `JavaDoc.java` file for the `class`, for the `main` method
and the field.

At a commmand prompt run the command

`javadoc -d docs JavaDoc.java`

The -d instructs it to place the output in the subfolder docs. In windows explorer visit that `docs` folder and double click `index.html`.  That should lead you into the generated documentation.

If you have more time then look in the documentation for `javadoc`. Experiment with more classes and with the special tags, like
`@return`, etc.
