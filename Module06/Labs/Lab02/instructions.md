The code in this file should print the sum of ten numbers starting from 1, 2, 3.... upto 10
So, the program should print the result of 1 + 2 + 3 .... 10 , which is 55. However, there is a bug lurking in this code, and it doesn't work as expected when run ...

Your task is to Debug this program!

1. Run this program at the command prompt to discover what the unexpected
output or "bug" might be. It's possible you may see no output at all, that is a valid bug too. Or, you may see the compiler give you an error message.

1. If you need to stop a run away program press Ctrl-C
1. Next, go through the code LINE BY LINE, and try to figure out what may be causing the program to behave unexpectedly
1. Once you have identified the bug or bugs, edit the code / add new code to get the program working properly. 
1. Good luck!

HINT : It can be helpful to write down the result of every line of code on a piece of rough paper ... just to help you with your debugging process.  Some of the most experienced programmers in the world still do this to help them debug a program!
