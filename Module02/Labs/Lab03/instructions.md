
## Decision making with `if`

1. Part 1
    - define an integer and give it a value
    - If the integer is less than 100 print the message "less than 100"
    - if it is greater or equal 100 print the message "greater or equal to 100"

1. Part 2
   - if the integer is within the range 1, 100 inclusive print a message
   - if the integer is outside that range print a different message
   - test the code with different values to be sure it works correctly
