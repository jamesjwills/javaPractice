
## Casting and conversion

1. Define a `double` variable, give it a value with a fractional part, and print it
2. Define an `int` variable.  Cast the `double` into the `int`. Print the result. See that the fractional part is lost
3. Define another `double` variable.  Convert the `int` back into the `double` and print the `double`. See that the fractional part cannot be recovered
