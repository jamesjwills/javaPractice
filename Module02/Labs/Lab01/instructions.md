1. Part 1
    - Define two integers (`int`), add them together, print the result


1. Part 2
    - Define two doubles (`double`), add them together, print the result.  Be careful; use `double` NOT `Double`.  Why will be explained later in the course



1. Part 3
    - Print out the seven times multiplication table for mutipliers 1 to 10
    - Ie. expected results 7, 14, 21, 28...
