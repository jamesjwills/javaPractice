Write a Program to check if the Area of a Rectangle is greater than its
Perimeter
The Area of a Rectangle is its length multiplied by its breadth; 
while its Perimeter is the sum of its length and breadth, multiplied by 2
For example : 
If length is 4, and breadth is 5, the Area is 4 x 5 = 20
and Perimeter  = 2 x ( 4 + 5) = 2 x 9 = 18
For this lab, you may assign the values of length and breadth in your code
Change the values of length and breadth a few times, just to make sure your program works for all comparisons correctly

## Bonus Lab - Simple Swap

Write some code to swap the values of two integers
For example, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 10
then after your program runs, the values should be swapped
IE, the values of the variables should be : num1 = 10 and num2 = 4
Try and think about how you can do this - do you need another variable? 
Write some code here .... the two integers are already defined for you
